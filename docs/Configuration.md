# Configuration

Aero requires a `config.json` file in your root directory.

```json
{
	"title": "My Awesome Site!"
}
```

Your configuration is incremental. This means you only need to include the settings that you changed.

The settings that have not been specified will be loaded from the [default configuration](https://github.com/aerojs/aero/blob/master/default/config.js).
